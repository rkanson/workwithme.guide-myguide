## Values

* I value **collaboration**. A single person can only accomplish so much, but a team working together can accomplish anything.
* I value **humor**. I'd prefer to be assigned a tough task with a funny joke rather than an easy task with a boring routine.
* I value **experimenting**. I learn best by trying out different things first, ***then*** reading the documentation.

## Personality

* If applicable, I like to communicate in gifs. A picture is worth a thousand words as they say, and I'm not quite that eloquent.
* Organization is my lifeline. I can get overwhelmed quickly if I have too many notifications/alerts. Especially if there are multiple notifications for the same thing within different avenues (Slack, Email, etc.)
* I'm, like George, *curious* and need to understand how a function/method/program works rather than just seeing *abstracted magic*. I prefer the magic stays at birthday parties & Vegas.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

How do you best receive feedback, be it positive or negative?

* For **positive** feedback, any avenue is acceptable. Sharing positive feedback amongst a group helps spread that happy vibe to everyone!
* For **negative** feedback, I prefer a 1:1. As with the previous, sharing negative feedback publicly kinda bums people out in my opinion.
* For **recognition**, see **positive** feedback notes.

## Work Patterns

What hours do you usually work?

* My primary timezone is **EST** -- New York time.
* As a fully **remote** worker I can be pretty flexible, but I like to keep within a (9-10) to (5-6) EST if possible.

When do you prefer to work alone, versus in groups?
 
* I'm open to working in groups if anyone asks/prefers to work that way, but am totally okay with going solo for some time.

How do your energy levels fluctuate throughout the day?

* I've got **severe** caffeine addiction, so excuse any foggy-brain I may have in the early mornings. Luckily, with timezone differences though, I may be reaching peak alertness once everyone else starts to get up!
* I accidentally started doing **IF (Intermittent Fasting)** in college, and have kept it up since then, so lunch breaks are super important to me. Coffee can help me push through my mornings, but if I don't eat by 1/2pm EST, I'll be of no use to anyone.

## Communication Preferences

* If you need me, **Slack** is your best bet.
* As with many Engineers, my email inbox is **flooded** with alerts and notifications. I try to trim where I can with filters, but I'm only human.

How should people best get your attention for urgent matters outside of normal working hours?

* **Slack** first, **text** second.

What’s your relationship to work communication when not at work?

* I’ll do what I can to respond upon availability.

What are your signs that you’d prefer to not be interrupted when at work?

* I try to set my Slack status accordingly -- and try to automate it to set it for things like meetings.

## Ask Me About

* Batman
* Dogs
* eSports (FPS focused, not super into MOBA's)
* Gaming in general (**LOVE** well written single-player rpgs. Uncharted, Horizon, Witcher, etc.)
* Personal finances (Love making reactive spreadsheets, especially for budgets)
